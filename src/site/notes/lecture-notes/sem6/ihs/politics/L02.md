# **IHS - L02**
# Political Science - Session 1
##### $8^{th}$ Jan, 24
## What is politics?
"He does lot of politics". What does it mean when we say this?

"Polis" - Greek word: city or state

### Different Interpretations

#### Aristotle - Father of political sciences
> A human being is a naturally political animal

**Possible interpretation**:-
```mermaid

id1(Humans tend to differ)
id2(These differences will lead to conflicts)
id3(These conflicts needs to be resolved)
id1 --> id2 --> id3
```

Since politics is an "essentially contested" concept, it has a number of legitimate and accepted definitions.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

id1(Politics)
id1.1(Make)
id1.2(Preserve)
id1.3(Amend)

id1 --> id1.1 & id1.2 & id1.3

id2(rules under which we live)

id1.1 --> id2
id1.2 --> id2
id1.3 --> id2
```
The rules keep changing. If a rule is made, it needs to be preserved, which is what typically a system does.

#### Bismark
> Politics is art.

#### Davis Easton
> authoritative allocation of values

```mermaid
flowchart TD

id1(There are given values in society) --> id2(The state will try to implement/enforce these values with authority)
```
```mermaid
flowchart TD

id1(Input: demands, support)
id2(Process: Political System)
id3(Output: law,rule,policy)

id1 --> id2 --> id3
id3 -->|reaction from society. not everyone will agree| id1

```

#### Lord Acton
- ==Power: capacity/capability to influence decision of others without doing anything==. If you do something, that is force
- Power needs to be attained and sustained

#### Politics as Public Affairs
> Personal is political
- Marital Rapes - legal or illegal?
#### Politics as Compromise and Consensus
> Who compromises is a game of power.

**In a truly democratic system, there are no additional qualifications added to be eligible to stand for elections so as to not prevent even a single person from becoming ineligible for the position. Otherwise doing so would have prevented someone or the other from standing in elections.**

#### Philosophical Tradition
**What should happen?**
#### Empirical Tradition
