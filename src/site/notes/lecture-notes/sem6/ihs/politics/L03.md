# State
## Definition
A **state** (also called a nation or country) is a territory with defined boundaries organized into a political unit and ruled by an established government that has control over its internal and foreign affairs. When a state has total control over its internal and foreign affairs, it is called a **sovereign state**. A location claimed by a sovereign state is called a **territory**. According to the United Nations, in 2016, the world had 193 nations; however, many of those nations dispute their boundaries.
